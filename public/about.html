<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lewu Daniel Oluwaseun, a young and promising Nigerian born into the Christian family of Mr and Mrs Taiwo Lewu on the 24th of June, 1998 in the city of Lagos. I hail from the native town of Ikija, in the ancient city of Abeokuta(the city of stones), Ogun State, located in the South Western geopolitical zone of Nigeria.</p>
<p>I was bread and nurtured in Mushin, Lagos State, the community in which I had spent most of my life. I attended Standard Nursery and Primary School, Mushin, for my primary education(2001 - 2009), then later on attended Ajumoni Secondary School for Secondary education, which is located at Iyana Isolo, Mushin, Lagos State(2009 - 2014). I continued in my educational journey while moving to the Ancient city of Ibadan, Oyo State for my Tertiary education, where I bagged a Barchalor of Science degree in Biochemistry(B. Sc Biochemistry) from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria's Premier University(2015 - 2021).</p>
<p>After the successful completion of my program at the University of Ibadan, I moved on to my home town for my NYSC(National youth service Corps) program to serve my mother land for a period of one year(2021 - 2022), thereafter I secured a job as an archivist in Stanbic IBTC Bank back in Lagos State.</p>
<p>The decision and conviction to swith fully into the software engineering carreer came as I saw my self falling more and more in love with the works of Programmers and I marvel greatly at how far they have made the world a great place to live. I am dedicated to continuing in this trend by doing everything in my might to make the world a the best place to live through technology and pass on the legacy to coming generations.</p>
